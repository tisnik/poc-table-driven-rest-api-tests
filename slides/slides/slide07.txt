Proposed solution
-----------------
▶ Table-driven approach
▶ Use Go arrays/slices of structs to define tests
▶ Pros
    ◆ syntax checks
    ◆ readability
    ◆ ability to specify callback functions/handlers to be called
      to perform action or check something
▶ Cons
    ◆ not much space to reinvent the wheel :)
